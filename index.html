    <p>I'm a 26-year-old aspiring web developer with a lifelong passion for technology. Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by how things work, and that curiosity naturally led me to web development. My keen eye for detail and creative flair make me particularly drawn to web design. My goal is to build amazing projects as I continue to grow and hone my development skills.</p>
